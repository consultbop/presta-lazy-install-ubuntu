# Installation
Use install.sh only for installation on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine.
This script is mainly for reference. 

# Architecture
_LAMP_
- Linux : Ubuntu 20.04
- Apache : Apache2
- MySQL : Version 5.7 (_Seems like DigitalOcean only supports 8. The whole configuration will have to be broken up and PHP extenstions will be needed_)
- PHP : PHP 7.2

# Prestashop Version
Currently using 1.7.8.1 version for setting the Prestashop CMS as required.
Make sure the theme and module version are compatible with 1.7.8.1.
If you are looking to change the version of Prestashop CMS, make sure you make that change in your install.sh script file.
